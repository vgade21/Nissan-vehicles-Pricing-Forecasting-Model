This Capstone project focuses on understanding the key factors that influence car prices in the American market. The main objective is to develop robust supervised models that can accurately predict the optimal Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for upcoming and prospective car models. By conducting comprehensive analysis, the project aims to uncover valuable insights that can support informed decision-making within the automotive industry.

To achieve this, the project will leverage both internal and external factors that impact car prices. These factors will include attributes such as the car's specifications, features, brand reputation, and historical pricing data. Additionally, external factors like inflation, material costs, GDP, and the Consumer Confidence Index will be considered to capture the broader economic context.

An important aspect of the project involves conducting an impact analysis using a time series model. This analysis will explore the relationship between the MSRP of new vehicles and the selected macroeconomic factors. By estimating the coefficients of these factors, the model will be able to forecast the MSRP based on different scenarios for the macroeconomic factors. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of how changes in the economic environment can impact car prices.

Ultimately, the project aims to provide valuable insights to car manufacturers, dealerships, and other stakeholders in the automotive industry. The accurate prediction of car prices can assist in pricing strategies, market positioning, and overall business planning. By incorporating both internal and external factors, as well as conducting impact analysis, the project seeks to enhance decision-making processes and contribute to the success of the automotive industry.
