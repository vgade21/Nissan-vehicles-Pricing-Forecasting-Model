# Nissan-vehicles-Pricing-Forecasting-Model

The project aims to understand the key determinants influencing car prices in the American market. Through comprehensive analysis, we strive to construct robust supervised models capable of predicting the optimal Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for upcoming and prospective car models. Leveraging critical internal and external factors, our goal is to uncover valuable insights and empower informed decision-making in the automotive industry.

An impact analysis using a time series model that analyzes the relationship between the MSRP of new vehicles and macroeconomic factors (inflation, material costs, GDP and Consumer confidence index)  will be incorporated into the MSRP model using the estimated coefficients to forecast the MSRP based on different scenarios for the macroeconomic factors.
